# Vocabulary

The foundational terms used across this repo's workflow system, each anchored to the
base principle it derives from. The vocabulary is *modern* (multi-agent orchestration,
LLM harnesses) but the mechanics are old: division of labor, message-passing
concurrency, control theory, the test-oracle problem, enabling bureaucracy. Naming the
root makes a term defensible rather than fashionable.

## How to use this document

- **Reference, not standing context.** This file is linked from the rules but is *not*
  injected into every session. Read it when a term is unclear; don't pay its token cost
  on every turn. (This is itself an application of the attention/context-load discipline
  the repo cares about.)
- **Single source of truth.** Before this file, "agent team" was defined in three places
  (`claude/rules/agent-teams-default.md`, `claude/skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md`,
  `openspec/changes/continuation-harness/design.md`). Those sections still exist for local
  context; this file is the canonical definition they should agree with. If they drift,
  this file wins and the others should be updated.

### Provenance convention

Base-principle attributions are load-bearing — a reader may act on them. So each carries
a provenance marker (per `claude/rules/evidence-provenance.md`):

- **Repo cites** — the lineage is stated in the repo's own files (verified, with path).
- **Roots** — a well-established origin from the general literature.
- **[analytical mapping]** — an interpretive connection drawn here, not claimed as the
  repo's documented intent.

## 1. Multi-agent organization

The core modern idea: instead of one agent doing everything serially, dispatch several
specialized agents that work in parallel and coordinate. The base principle is the oldest
one in management — **division of labor** (Smith, Babbage) — combined with
**message-passing concurrency** (the actor model) for how the agents talk.

- **Agent / subagent** — An independent Claude instance dispatched to do a scoped piece
  of work, with its own context window. A *subagent* is one dispatched by another agent
  (the "main" or "parent" agent). Its final message is returned to the parent as a result;
  it is not shown to the user.
  *Roots:* the actor model (Hewitt, 1973) — independent computational entities that
  process work and communicate only by messages.

- **Named agent** — An agent dispatched with an explicit `name`, making it addressable.
  Only named agents can be sent messages or coordinate. Anonymous agents
  (`Agent(prompt=...)` with no name) are fire-and-forget and cannot participate in a team.
  *In repo:* `claude/hooks/enforce_named_agents.py` blocks teamless multi-agent dispatch.

- **Team / `TeamCreate`** — The shared infrastructure that lets named agents communicate.
  A team requires three things together: `TeamCreate` (once), plus `name` and `team_name`
  on every agent. Missing any one means the agents are isolated subprocesses that cannot
  coordinate.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/agent-teams-default.md` (the canonical "three things" rule).
  *Roots:* a team is a shared communication channel — a *blackboard* / shared workspace
  in classic AI architecture [analytical mapping].

- **`SendMessage`** — The primitive by which agents on a team exchange findings, argue, or
  hand off work. Coordination happens here, not in the main agent's head.
  *Roots:* message-passing concurrency (actor model); cf. Erlang/OTP, which the harness
  design doc cites by name.

- **Roundtable** — A team of named agents that *argue* with each other via `SendMessage`,
  each holding a persona/position. Critically: a roundtable is **never** simulated dialogue
  written in the main agent's output — it is always real dispatched agents.
  *In repo:* `claude/skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md:208` and
  `agent-teams-default.md:54`.
  *Roots:* adversarial collaboration / dialectic — independent positions tested against
  each other produce better conclusions than a single voice.

- **Panel of experts** — Like a roundtable, but the agents hold *different expertise*
  rather than opposing positions; they share findings to assemble a fuller picture.
  *Roots:* ensemble/diversity — independent specialists catch failure modes a single
  generalist misses [analytical mapping].

- **`adversarial-reviewer`** — A specialized agent type that runs with *no conversation
  history* and sees only the artifact under review, motivated to find failures. The
  isolation is the point: it cannot be biased by the author's reasoning.
  *In repo:* `claude/agents/adversarial-reviewer.md`.
  *Roots:* independent verification — the reviewer must not be the author.

### Agent pairing patterns

These are roles agents take *relative to each other*, from `agent-teams-default.md`:

- **Independent test agent** — Writes tests from the spec/success criteria, **without
  reading the implementation**. Catches the gap between what the spec says and what the
  code does, because the tester never saw the code.

- **Mutation challenger** — Before implementation, invents 2-5 plausible *bad*
  implementations and asks whether the proposed tests would catch each. Blocks
  implementation until the named fragile shortcut fails at least one check.
  *Roots:* mutation testing — a test suite is only as good as the mutants it kills.

- **Outcome verifier** — After implementation and review, verifies the *actual
  user-facing result* (runs the report, calls the endpoint, exercises the flow), not just
  "tests pass."
  *Roots:* the distinction between verification (built it right) and validation (built the
  right thing).

---

## 2. Workflow orchestration

When the *control flow* between agents should be deterministic (loops, fan-out,
conditionals) rather than decided turn-by-turn by a model, it is encoded as a **workflow**
— a script that spawns agents programmatically.

- **Workflow** — A script (`Workflow` tool) that orchestrates many agents
  deterministically: it decides what runs in parallel, what verifies what, what
  synthesizes. Runs in the background and returns a structured result.

- **Fan-out** — Spawning many agents at once over a work-list (one per file, dimension,
  channel). Each is blind to the others.
  *Roots:* the *map* phase of MapReduce; SPMD parallelism.

- **Barrier** — A synchronization point that waits for *all* parallel agents before
  continuing. Correct only when the next stage genuinely needs every prior result at once
  (dedup across the full set, early-exit on zero, cross-item comparison).
  *Roots:* the barrier primitive in parallel computing (e.g., `MPI_Barrier`).

- **Pipeline** — Running each item through all stages independently, with *no barrier*
  between stages: item A can be in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1. The default
  multi-stage shape, because wall-clock equals the slowest single chain, not the sum of
  slowest-per-stage.
  *Roots:* pipeline parallelism / instruction pipelining — overlap stages instead of
  draining each.

- **Adversarial verify (in a workflow)** — After a fan-out of finders, spawn independent
  skeptics per finding, each prompted to *refute* it; keep only findings that survive.
  Converts plausible-but-wrong output into evidence.
  *Roots:* falsificationism (Popper) — a claim earns belief by surviving attempts to
  refute it.

- **Loop-until-dry** — For unknown-size discovery, keep spawning finders until *K
  consecutive rounds* return nothing new, rather than a fixed count. Catches the tail a
  simple `while count < N` misses.

---

## 3. Beads — task tracking

**Beads** (`bd`) is the issue tracker. Its non-obvious architecture: issues live in a
local **Dolt** database (a versioned SQL database); sync travels over `refs/dolt/data` on
the git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a *passive export*, not the source of truth.

- **Bead / issue** — A single tracked unit of work (task, bug, feature, epic, spec, spike)
  with id, status, priority (P0–P4), dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

- **Dolt** — The versioned SQL database backing beads. "Beads breaks" usually means a Dolt
  state problem (see `claude/rules/beads-worktree-integration.md`).
  *Roots:* Dolt = "Git for data" — version control semantics applied to a SQL database.

- **Ready / blocked** — A bead is *ready* when nothing it depends on is open (`bd ready`);
  *blocked* when a dependency remains. The dependency graph is a **DAG**.
  *Roots:* topological scheduling — execute only nodes whose predecessors are complete.

- **Spec issue / `--spec-id`** — A reusable issue holding behavioral contracts
  (WHEN/THEN). Multiple task beads reference the same spec via `--spec-id`, giving
  longitudinal coverage tracking via named requirement IDs.
  *In repo:* `claude/hooks/spec_id_enforcement.py` validates the reference resolves to a
  real spec + anchor.

- **`bd remember` / memory** — Persistent knowledge stored in beads (not in MEMORY.md
  files), surfaced via `bd prime` in future sessions.

---

## 4. Molecules & formulas

A **molecule** is a composed, multi-step workflow instantiated from a reusable template
(a **formula**). The chemistry metaphor: a formula is the recipe, pouring it creates the
molecule (a connected graph of bead tasks + gates).

- **Formula** — A reusable template defining the steps, gates, and dependencies of a
  workflow. Two ship today: `mol-rapid` (bug/chore, 2 steps, no gates) and `mol-feature`
  (feature, gated pipeline).
  *In repo:* `beads/formulas/*.formula.json`. *Roots:* templating / scaffolding —
  capturing a proven process so it isn't re-derived each time.

- **Pour** — Instantiating a formula into live beads (`bd mol pour mol-feature ...`):
  creates the root epic, all step tasks, and gate tasks with their dependencies.

- **Phase** — The user-facing stage of a molecule. `mol-feature`'s phases:
  **THINK** (challenge whether to build at all) → **DESIGN** (discovery + work-breakdown)
  → **VALIDATE** (walking skeleton + review gate) → **BUILD** (full execution + spec
  audit) → **LEARN** (retrospective + outcome check).
  *In repo:* phase strings in `beads/formulas/mol-feature.formula.json`; user-facing
  mapping in `claude/rules/molecule-awareness.md`.

- **Gate (molecule gate)** — A decision point in a molecule where progress pauses for a
  human approve/revise/stop decision. Distinct from a *hook gate* (§6).
  *Roots:* stage-gate process (Cooper) — go/no-go checkpoints between phases.

- **Walking skeleton** — The first deliverable of any feature: the minimum end-to-end
  system that tests the *riskiest assumption* (1–3 tasks, 30–60 min each). Built before
  the bulk of the feature.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/planning-discipline.md` ("The Walking Skeleton Rule").
  *Roots:* the term is Alistair Cockburn's — a tiny end-to-end implementation that
  exercises the architecture before fleshing it out.

- **Scope circuit breaker** — Hard ceilings on how many spec/task issues a feature may
  spawn, applied during work-breakdown to prevent spec inflation.
  *In repo:* `beads/formulas/mol-feature.formula.json` (DESIGN phase).
  *Roots:* WIP limits / batch-size control (Lean, Kanban).

---

## 5. The continuation-harness

A deterministic system that enforces **outcome-bias over action-bias**: an agent may not
*stop* until it has proven completion, scheduled its own resumption, or been released by
the user. It exists because agents sincerely report "done" when they are not.

- **Contract (`contract.json`)** — A declaration, made before implementation, of what
  "done" means (`--goal`) and the shell command whose exit 0 proves it
  (`--verify`). *Declare before acting; verify before stopping.*
  *In repo:* `harness/bin/init_contract.py`.

- **Oracle (verification command)** — The `--verify` command whose exit code *mechanically*
  demonstrates the outcome. The oracle is the heart of the contract: a weak oracle
  (`--verify true`) is a fake contract.
  *Roots:* the **test oracle** in software testing — the mechanism that decides whether a
  result is correct. The "oracle problem" (how do you know the answer?) is the field's
  classic hard problem.

- **`verify`** — The script that runs the contract's oracle, records the result, and exits
  with the same code. Exit 0 within the turn window permits Stop.
  *In repo:* `harness/bin/verify`.

- **Stop gate** — The deterministic hook that blocks an agent from ending its turn unless
  one of three paths holds: verification passed this turn, a wakeup is registered, or the
  user released. The block is *noise, not work-halting* — the turn ends, the user sees a
  resumption prompt, the conversation continues.
  *In repo:* `harness/bin/stop_hook.py`, `would_block_stop.py`.

- **`ScheduleWakeup`** — Registering a future check-in when work genuinely waits on an
  external event (CI, a merge, a DAG run). The structured alternative to writing "I'll
  check back" as prose and stopping — *prose-as-polling* is the largest measured stall
  class.
  *In repo:* `scheduled.json` in the session thread dir.

- **Outcome-bias (vs action-bias)** — The governing principle: more tool calls, more
  subagent dispatches, more bead-claims do **not** substitute for proof of completion or
  proof of resumption. Action is not outcome.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/continuation-harness.md`, `outcome-ownership.md`.

- **Level-triggered vs edge-triggered** — A level-triggered gate re-evaluates state on
  *every* Stop attempt (the queue is empty or it isn't); an edge-triggered gate fires once
  on a transition and is bypassable by missing the edge. The Stop gate is level-triggered,
  so it is stateless and idempotent.
  *Repo cites:* `openspec/changes/continuation-harness/design.md:152` — borrowed from the
  Kubernetes reconciler architecture.

- **Liveness vs safety** — *Safety:* the gate never allows a bad stop (no false positives).
  *Liveness:* a good stop is eventually always allowed (no false negatives). The harness
  prioritizes safety over liveness deliberately.
  *Repo cites:* `design.md:156` — Lamport's safety/liveness distinction.

- **Supervisor strategies** — The three resumption paths map to Erlang/OTP restart
  strategies: verification-passed → *temporary*; user-released → *transient*; neither →
  *permanent* (must restart on exit).
  *Repo cites:* `design.md:154`.

- **Task-mode / queue-drain** — A session-scope stopping criterion: a session does not end
  until all beads tasks in its queue are claimed or drained (checked with `bd ready` AND
  `bd list` to distinguish *done* from *blocked*). Picking up unrelated ready tasks to
  satisfy the gate is scope creep, not progress.
  *Repo cites:* `design.md:160` flags this as novel prior-art-wise.

---

## 6. Bureaucracy & gate design

The repo frames *itself* as a bureaucracy — a structured set of routines that turn
problem-solving successes into reusable practice — and insists those routines stay
**lean, learning, and enabling** rather than decaying.

- **Bureaucracy (operative sense)** — Not pejorative: the codified routines (hooks, rules,
  skills, harnesses) that prevent re-solving solved problems.
  *Repo cites:* Schwartz (2020); `claude/rules/delicate-art-of-bureaucracy.md`.

- **Enabling vs coercive formalization** — The central distinction. *Enabling* procedures
  give the practitioner discretion, expose their rationale, and treat deviations as
  learning. *Coercive* procedures exist to force compliance and treat deviation as suspect.
  *Repo cites:* Adler & Borys (1996) — *the* operative source.

- **The four design features** — The tests every gate must pass: **repair** (can the user
  fix a misfire themselves?), **internal transparency** (does it explain *why*?), **global
  transparency** (can a newcomer see how it fits the whole?), **flexibility** (is there a
  reasoned-exception path?).
  *Repo cites:* Adler & Borys (1996); `delicate-art-of-bureaucracy.md`.

- **The four failure modes** — How bureaucracies decay: **bloated** (more rules than the
  risk warrants), **petrified** (rules that outlived their problem), **coercive** (gates
  that say "no" without enabling the next step), **mock** (rules followed for symbolic
  value but gamed in practice).

- **Mock bureaucracy** — The specific failure where an agent satisfies a gate's letter
  (a fake `--spec-id`, throwaway waiver text) without doing the underlying work. Both
  enabling *and* coercive designs can produce it if implementation conditions are wrong.
  *Repo cites:* Wiesche, Schermann & Krcmar (2013).

- **Hook gate** — A `PreToolUse`/`Stop`/etc. hook that intercepts an action and denies,
  asks, or warns. Distinct from a *molecule gate* (§4, a human decision point).
  *In repo:* `claude/hooks/*.py`.

- **Escape path** — The first-class, agent-invokable way *past* a gate that does not
  require disabling it (e.g., "say 'proceed' to skip TDD"). Gate-design Rule 1: every gate
  must have one.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/gate-design.md`.

- **Waiver** — A reasoned exception asserted via a standard flag
  (`--<gate-name>-waiver "<reason>"`). The reason is required free-text (≥20 chars, no
  placeholders), persisted as labeled training data, and never expires from the log.
  *Roots:* deviations as learning opportunities (the *flexibility* design feature).

- **Signal** — The durable record a gate produces (a bead, a log line, an audit record, a
  waiver entry). Gate-design Rule 2: a gate whose decisions live only in the conversation
  produces no learning data and "you cannot prune what you cannot count."
  *In repo:* `claude/hooks/_gate_signal.py`.

- **Value-not-presence validation** — Gate-design Rule 3: a gate that requires a value must
  check the value *resolves* (a real file/anchor) or *meets a substance threshold*, not
  merely that *something* was supplied — otherwise it manufactures mock bureaucracy by
  rewarding the shortest passing string.

- **Half-life** — Every rule gets an annual review minimum; a rule unrevised in a year is a
  candidate for re-justification, not veneration.
  *Roots:* the operating rule against *petrification*.

---

## 7. TDD, oracles & test quality

The discipline that a test must prove *user/business behavior*, not echo the
implementation. Sequence: **Outcome → Oracle → Constraints → Tests → Code.**

- **Test Oracle Brief** — The pre-implementation document naming the business invariant,
  the independent source of truth, the invalid solution classes, a fragile implementation
  to reject, and positive/negative controls. Required before non-trivial implementation.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/tdd-enforcement.md`; `claude/hooks/test_oracle_brief_gate.py`.

- **Oracle (test)** — The independent source of truth that decides correctness *without
  reference to the implementation*. See §5 for the harness's contract-oracle.

- **Implementation echo** — A test that passes by *repeating* the production code's
  constant, algorithm, private helper, mock interaction, or generated ID. Forbidden,
  because it would also pass the fragile shortcut it claims to guard against.
  *In repo:* `claude/hooks/implementation_echo_test_gate.py`.

- **Oracle downgrade** — Weakening what a test *proves* to make it pass: swapping a
  business-outcome assertion for an implementation detail, testing an intermediate artifact
  instead of the user-facing output, removing a negative control. Forbidden.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/never-suppress.md`; `claude/hooks/oracle_downgrade_warning_gate.py`.

- **Positive control** — A fixture/input that proves valid output is *not accidentally
  dropped* (the fix didn't make the result empty).
  *Roots:* experimental design — a positive control confirms the assay can detect a true
  signal.

- **Negative control** — A fixture/input that *should fail* if the code is wrong. A test
  with no negative control cannot demonstrate it protects anything.
  *Roots:* experimental design — a negative control confirms the assay isn't always-positive.

- **Behavioral config (not exempt)** — Config that *drives runtime behavior* (CI YAML,
  Terraform, k8s manifests, DAGs). "It parses" is a gate, not an oracle; the verification
  owed scales with behavioral risk (parse → lint → predict → observe).
  *In repo:* `tdd-enforcement.md` § "Behavioral config is not exempt".

- **Never-suppress** — When something fails, fix *why* it fails; never make the failure
  invisible (no skip lists, `# noqa`, `except: pass`, error→warning downgrades, `--no-verify`).
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/never-suppress.md`.

---

## 8. Planning, discovery & specs

- **OpenSpec change** — A structured unit of proposed work living in
  `openspec/changes/{name}/`, holding the `design.md` (design intent — the authority on
  *why*), `specs/` (behavioral contracts), and tasks.
  *Authority:* `design.md` wins on design intent; beads wins on task state.

- **Discovery** — The pre-design-doc phase that produces genuine thinking via adversarial
  questions (riskiest assumption, non-goals), not checkbox compliance. Routed to by
  brainstorming based on complexity.
  *In repo:* `claude/skills/discovery/`, `claude/rules/planning-discipline.md`.

- **Brainstorming** — The entry skill that challenges whether work should be done *at all*
  and rotates creative lenses to fight semantic clustering, then routes to discovery or
  planning.

- **Work-breakdown** — Translating a validated design into a beads task graph with
  outcome-based acceptance criteria, failure modes, scope boundaries, and `--spec-id`
  traceability.
  *In repo:* `claude/skills/work-breakdown/`.

- **Proof of delivery** — The single sentence describing the actual user-facing outcome
  that must be true for the work to count as delivered; verified by running the real
  workflow, not by "tests pass."
  *Roots:* the *outcome-ownership* principle (§5).

---

## 9. Navigation, memory & epistemics

- **Serena** — An LSP-backed semantic code tool (MCP). Preferred over grep+read for code
  *navigation* and *editing*: symbol overview, find-symbol, find-references,
  replace-symbol-body. Grep/Read are fallbacks for string literals and short files.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/serena-first.md`.

- **context-mode** — A plugin that does heavy processing in a sandbox and surfaces only the
  derived answer, keeping raw bytes out of the conversation. Note the standing tension: it
  *saves* context while always-on rules *consume* it.
  *Roots:* the "Think-in-Code" idea — program the analysis instead of reading raw data into
  the window.

- **The memory systems (and their guidance conflict)** — Several stores coexist:
  `bd remember` (beads, project task knowledge), `~/.claude/.../memory/` (user-scoped,
  cross-project, file-per-fact), Serena memory (project-scoped, cross-session), and the
  harness's own memory instructions. Guidance about MEMORY.md files differs between them;
  when in doubt, the project's `CLAUDE.md` (prefer `bd remember`, no MEMORY.md) governs
  beads-tracked repos. *This overlap is a known integration seam, documented here so it
  isn't rediscovered each session.*

- **Load-bearing claim** — A claim where, if it were wrong, a decision/design/recommendation
  downstream would change. Such claims must be verified, marked (`[inferred]`, "likely"),
  asked, or placeholdered — never asserted with the flat confidence of a measured fact.
  *In repo:* `claude/rules/evidence-provenance.md`.

- **Provenance marker** — The language that calibrates a reader's confidence to the
  author's (`[inferred]`, "appears to", "I'm assuming"). What lets a reader trust
  *selectively* instead of re-auditing or blindly trusting everything.
