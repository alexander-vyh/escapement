# TDD Enforcement — Global Rule

## Outcome -> Oracle -> Constraints -> Tests -> Code

For any non-trivial implementation task, do not start implementation until the test
strategy has been reviewed for oracle quality. Required sequence:

1. Clarify the business/user outcome.
2. Identify the independent source of truth.
3. Identify solution constraints from the repo, architecture, language, framework,
   security model, and maintainability requirements.
4. Write or update tests that define the valid solution space: behavioral tests for the
   outcome, positive controls so the fix does not make the result empty, negative
   controls for known bad cases, contract tests for public interfaces, and
   architecture/static checks for invalid implementation classes.
5. Challenge those tests with plausible bad implementations.
6. Choose the smallest implementation that satisfies the tests and constraints.
7. Implement.
8. Verify the final user-facing/business-facing outcome.

Passing tests are not enough if they could also pass a fragile or invalid implementation.

## Test Oracle Brief Required

Before writing implementation code for any non-trivial change, the QC/test lane must
produce a Test Oracle Brief covering:

1. **Business invariant** — what user/business outcome must be true?
2. **Independent source of truth** — what determines correctness independently of the
   implementation?
3. **Solution constraints** — repo, architecture, language, framework, security,
   ownership, maintainability.
4. **Invalid solution classes** — what implementations are disallowed even if they
   produce the output?
5. **Fragile implementation to reject** — name at least one tempting shortcut the tests
   must fail.
6. **Negative control** — what fixture, row, request, role, or input should fail if the
   code is wrong?
7. **Positive control** — what proves valid output is not accidentally dropped?
8. **Missing/unresolved handling** — should missing source data fail closed, fail open,
   or be explicitly allowed?
9. **Final outcome verification** — what command, query, report, API call, UI flow, or
   workflow proves the actual result?

A test plan fails review if the named fragile implementation would pass every behavioral,
fixture, contract, architecture, and static check.

### Rapid form (low-blast-radius changes)

The 9-section brief is the default. A low-blast-radius change may use exactly three
Markdown sections when their labeled evidence is semantically complete:

1. **Business invariant** — `Outcome`, `Independent source of truth`, `Binding
   constraints`, and every rapid eligibility decision. Each protected-surface field
   must be exactly `no`. Root cause must include observed executable evidence as
   `Root cause: <Command|Query|API|Report|UI>: <action>; Expected: <cause>;
   Actual: <same cause>; Match: yes`. The planned proof below is also the executable
   outcome-oracle attestation, so rapid does not duplicate that authority in a
   second yes/no field.
2. **Negative control** — `Named fragile implementation`, `Negative control`,
   `Positive control`, and `Missing/unresolved handling`. When drop-all or empty
   output could pass, the positive control must preserve a valid result and uses the
   same planned-proof syntax as user-facing verification. Its expected result cannot
   be empty, dropped, suppressed, absent, or negated. Rapid always records a concrete
   positive control and missing-data disposition; `N/A` or an inapplicability claim
   requires the full lane rather than prose interpretation by the gate.
3. **Final outcome verification** — `Exact user-facing verification` uses
   `<Command|Query|API|Report|UI>: <action>; Expected: <result>`. Planned proof is
   enough for edits and an early durable task-branch commit or push. PR creation
   additionally requires `Focused proof result: Expected: ...; Actual: ...; Match:
   yes`, `Objective blockers: none`, `Known limitations: none`, and structured
   remaining landing proof. Merge or task closure also requires `Observed result:
   Expected: ...; Actual: ...; Match: yes`. In observed proof, `Actual` must equal
   `Expected`; focused and final observed proof must also equal the planned expected
   result. `Command` actions must resolve an executable and use parseable argv with
   an option, path, or qualified argument; `Report` actions begin with `Run` or
   `Generate` followed by that command shape. This rejects sentence-shaped fictional
   commands. Dynamic `eval` in a finishing shell command is treated as final and
   therefore requires final proof.

Rapid is fail-closed. Every exclusion below must be explicitly absent; `unknown`
means use the full form:

- Authorization/security
- Money or sensitive data
- Production mutation
- Schema/migration
- Public contracts
- Irreversible external effects
- Shared infrastructure
- Root cause is not known
- Executable outcome oracle is absent

Stop rapid execution in the current run and move to the full lane if a protected
surface is discovered, the boundary expands, reversibility becomes uncertain,
discriminating controls cannot be constructed, root cause remains unresolved, or
the outcome oracle is missing.

The fragile-implementation challenge is mandatory in both forms. The rapid form
compresses presentation; it never drops independent truth, binding constraints,
discriminating controls, missing-data behavior, or final user-facing proof.

## Implementation-Echo Tests Are Not Accepted

A test is an implementation echo if it passes by repeating the same constant, algorithm,
private helper, mock interaction, generated ID, or intermediate detail the production
code uses. Reject or rewrite tests that:

- use the same magic constant or generated ID as the implementation
- recompute the same algorithm as the implementation
- assert private helper calls instead of externally visible behavior
- mock the thing being tested and only assert the mock was called
- validate an intermediate artifact when the user cares about final output
- would pass the shortcut implementation the user explicitly rejected
- have no negative control for the bug they claim to protect
- cannot explain the business invariant they protect

A test that fails before implementation is still insufficient if it would also pass the
known fragile implementation.

## When TDD Applies

In any repo with a `tests/` directory or root-level test files: write the brief, review
it, write the failing test FIRST, run it and confirm it fails *for the right reason*,
challenge it against plausible bad implementations, write the minimal implementation, run
it green, then refactor keeping tests green.

Never silently skip TDD in a test-capable repo. Either follow it or get explicit
permission to skip.

## Exemptions

- Test files themselves
- **Passive** config and docs (`.toml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.md` an app merely *reads* as
  data — the app's own tests cover behavior). Not behavioral config; see below.
- Files in `scripts/`, `bin/`, `tools/`, `scratch/`, `spike/`
- Outside git repos
- User says "prototype", "spike", "throwaway", "one-off", "experiment"
- Bug fixes and chores in repos without test infrastructure

## Behavioral config is not exempt

The exemption covers *passive* config. It does NOT cover **behavioral config** — files
that drive runtime behavior and break silently and expensively in production: CI workflow
YAML, Terraform/OpenTofu/HCL, Kubernetes manifests, Airflow DAGs, dbt configs.

For these, "it parses" and "it's well-formed" are **gates, not oracles**. A schema-valid
workflow can still suppress a deploy trigger; a valid HCL plan can still destroy the
wrong resource. Verification owed scales with behavioral risk:

<!-- escapement:detail:start -->

| Rung | What it proves | Required |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Parse | valid syntax | gate only — never sufficient alone |
| Schema-lint (`actionlint`, `tofu validate`, `kubeconform`) | well-formed + self-consistent; catches shellcheck / expression-context / type / ref errors | **mandatory on every behavioral-config change** |
| Predict (`tofu plan` + deterministic JSON assertion; `kubectl apply --dry-run=server`) | the change-set this produces vs current state | required for IaC / manifest config-authoring changes |
| Observe (`gh workflow run` + assert the downstream run started; apply-to-sandbox / terratest) | the actual behavior happened | required for trigger / auth / deploy-gating logic — the only oracle for that class |


<!-- escapement:detail:end -->

**Lint alone is forbidden as the verification for trigger / auth / deploy-gating
changes.** A GitHub workflow whose `GITHUB_TOKEN`-authored merge silently fails to
re-trigger `on: push` (GitHub's server-side recursion guard) is schema-perfect and
behaviorally broken — only observing a real trigger catches it.

**When a behavior genuinely cannot be reproduced locally** (platform semantics, no
sandbox), that is a **structured waiver, not an exemption**: state (a) why it cannot
repro, (b) the platform behavior at risk, (c) the post-merge observation that WILL
confirm it (e.g. `gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml` shows a run for the merged SHA), and
(d) a human ack. A waiver makes the gap visible and time-bound; silence makes it a
production incident.

Caveat: the higher rungs need state, credentials, and connectivity — "deterministic"
means *deterministic given creds*, not offline. Terraform `import`-block planning does a
live provider read per target, so an import-block contract's `verification_command`
cannot be assumed runnable in a credential-free context.
