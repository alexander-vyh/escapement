"""Shared signal-capture for Claude Code gate hooks.

Per `claude/rules/gate-design.md` Rule 2: every gate must produce
persistent signal. This module is the canonical implementation —
all gates in `claude/hooks/` call `record()` at every decision point
so the corpus of gate-firings is uniform, queryable, and amenable to
the half-life review that Operating Rule 1 of the bureaucracy
principle requires.

## API

    from _gate_signal import record
    record(gate_name="spec_id_enforcement",
           decision="deny",
           reason="placeholder value 'none'",
           command="bd create --type=task ...")

## Storage shape

Each call appends one JSON line to `.beads/.gate-signal.jsonl`:

    {"ts": "2026-05-26T22:42:21Z",
     "gate": "spec_id_enforcement",
     "decision": "deny",
     "reason": "placeholder value 'none'",
     "session_id": "67b9768d-...",
     "extras": {"command": "bd create ..."}}

## Failure behavior

The gate's primary job is enforcement; logging is secondary. If the
`.beads/` directory doesn't exist, or the file isn't writable, or
disk is full, `record()` silently swallows the error. A failed
record never blocks a real gate decision — that would invert
priorities.

## Querying

See `claude/bin/gate_signal_query.py` for the canonical reader.
