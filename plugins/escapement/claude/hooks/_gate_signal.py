"""Shared signal-capture for Claude Code gate hooks.

Per `claude/rules/gate-design.md` Rule 2: every gate must produce
persistent signal. This module is the canonical implementation —
all gates in `claude/hooks/` call `record()` at every decision point
so the corpus of gate-firings is uniform, queryable, and amenable to
the half-life review that Operating Rule 1 of the bureaucracy
principle requires.

## API

    from _gate_signal import record
    record(gate_name="spec_id_enforcement",
           decision="deny",
           reason="placeholder value 'none'",
           command="bd create --type=task ...")

## Storage shape

Each call appends one JSON line to `.beads/.gate-signal.jsonl`:

    {"ts": "2026-05-26T22:42:21Z",
     "gate": "spec_id_enforcement",
     "decision": "deny",
     "reason": "placeholder value 'none'",
     "session_id": "67b9768d-...",
     "extras": {"command": "bd create ..."}}

With one exception: a row whose `decision` is exactly `"allow"` is NOT
persisted. An allow is the gate's null result — it records that a gate ran and
found nothing, which no reader consumes and no review acts on. In the live
corpus 59,457 of 106,724 rows were allow rows, so more than half the store was
noise that every query had to filter past. Every other decision (`deny`,
`warn`, `nudge`, `waiver-accepted`, `waiver-rejected`, `override-applied`,
`override-rejected`, and any gate-specific string) is written exactly as
before. `record()` still returns ``True`` for a skipped allow: the write was
not attempted, not failed, and no gate's decision may turn on it.

## Failure behavior

The gate's primary job is enforcement; logging is secondary. If persistence
fails, `record()` returns ``False`` without raising so callers that need an
operator-visible diagnostic can emit one without changing the gate decision.

## Querying

See `claude/bin/gate_signal_query.py` for the canonical reader.
