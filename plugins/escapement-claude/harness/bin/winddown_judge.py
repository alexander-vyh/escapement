"""Local-LLM judge layer for the continuation-harness wind-down rung.

Calls the local Rapid-MLX model (OpenAI-compatible API at localhost:8000, the same
backend the `local-llm` MCP server wraps) to classify whether an assistant turn-final
message abandons already-requested reversible work. This is the SWE-PRM pattern — a
separate model judging the request/response trajectory, handling nuance that regex
patterns cannot.

Two invariants, both TESTED:
  - FAIL-OPEN: any model error / timeout / unparseable verdict → None, and `decide`
    returns ("allow", "no_winddown_offer"). The gate NEVER depends on the model being up.
    The outage is signalled at the hook layer (stop_hook._winddown_override) per
    gate-design Rule 2.
  - JUDGE OWNS RECALL: `decide` blocks only when the model flags an offer (gated by
    reversible-work-remaining, which prevents nagging a legitimate stop). The judge/rung
    path has no regex floor — None verdict means no classifier fired → allow. The Stop
    hook may still run its separate high-confidence outage sentinel after logging the
    unavailable judge signal.

The Stop hook reads a fresh cached verdict when present, otherwise computes one
inline with the shared bounded local-judge client. A future background monitor
can still warm the same cache.

# reach the user unblocked while the narrower wrap-only prompt classified it not_winddown.

# nagging legitimate clarifying questions. The genuine-decision carve-out is predicated

# event is a wrap dressed as a decision (the cake 845ae4ea live miss, 2026-07-01 — the
# agent owns ScheduleWakeup for waiting, so waiting is never the user's pick to make).

    "You classify an AI coding agent's last request/response pair. Reply with ONLY one word: "
    "winddown | not_winddown | unclear.\n\n"
    "The LAST HUMAN REQUEST and TERMINAL ASSISTANT RESPONSE are delimited in the input. "
    "Judge whether the response leaves reversible work already requested by the human "
    "unfinished, even when it does not explicitly ask permission or offer to stop.\n\n"
    "DECISIVE TEST (apply first): Could the agent simply DO the next reversible step "
    "itself right now? If yes and it is asking permission or offering instead of just "
    "doing it -> winddown. If it genuinely needs the human to CHOOSE between real "
    "alternatives or to AUTHORIZE something outside delegated authority that the agent "
    "cannot reverse or lacks access "
    "for -> not_winddown.\n\n"
    "'winddown' = the agent is pausing when it should keep working. Four shapes:\n"
    "  1. WRAP/HANDOFF: offers to stop, wrap for the night, hand off, push-and-wrap, or "
    "asks 'is this a good stopping point?' / 'which way: continue or stop?'.\n"
    "  2. PERMISSION-PUNT: offers to do the obvious next in-scope work and asks permission "
    "to proceed instead of just doing it. Tells: 'Want me to ...?', 'Want me to go ahead "
    "and ...?', 'I can do both now - want me to proceed?'. The work (drafting, searching, "
    "editing, a write-up) is REVERSIBLE, so the agent should just do it. A trailing "
    "'you'd just review' or 'hand you a ready-to-send draft - you'd review and send' does "
    "NOT make it not_winddown: producing a draft for the user to review is exactly the "
    "reversible work the agent should have just done. Only the actual send/deploy/commit "
    "may require attention when it crosses delegated authority.\n"
    "  - AUTHORIZED ORDINARY MEANS: work already authorized by the delegated outcome "
    "or repository policy is not categorically human-only merely because it has an "
    "external effect. Commit, task-branch push, pull-request create/update, causal "
    "repair, and the repository's standard declared landing path remain agent work. "
    "Asking permission for those steps is a permission-punt unless the message names "
    "a real undelegated boundary.\n"
    "  3. FAKE CHOICE: an (a)/(b) or either-or question where ANY option amounts to "
    "waiting for an external event (a merge, a deploy, CI, another agent), holding, "
    "deferring, or picking the work up later. Offering 'wait' as one option is a wrap "
    "dressed as a decision.\n\n"
    "  4. UNFINISHED STATUS: the response states that a remaining/next step still needs "
    "to be done, describes what the agent would do next, or lists unfinished work, then "
    "ends without doing it. No question, permission request, or explicit stopping phrase "
    "is required. If the human asked for the outcome end to end and the response says "
    "'the remaining step is X', classify winddown unless X requires a credential, access, "
    "or consequential human choice the agent genuinely lacks.\n\n"
    "'not_winddown' = a legitimate turn that should NOT be nagged:\n"
    "  - reporting progress or results with no offer to stop;\n"
    "  - correctly honoring an explicit READ-ONLY, DIAGNOSE-ONLY, DO-NOT-EDIT, or "
    "DO-NOT-RESTART boundary. A diagnostic response may identify a likely fix or next "
    "step without being unfinished work, because the human explicitly withheld authority "
    "to execute it;\n"
    "  - a GENUINE decision needing the user's preference (two materially different options "
    "with real trade-offs: which database, which architecture);\n"
    "  - an action outside the delegated outcome that would add a new external audience, "
    "privilege, credential, expense, or destructive/irreversible shared effect. External "
    "is not sufficient by itself; already-delegated standard landing actions remain "
    "ordinary means.\n\n"
    "Examples:\n"
    "- \"Want me to pull the exact config keys and write up the migration steps? I can do "
    "both now - you'd just review.\" -> winddown (reversible work, agent should just do it)\n"
    "- \"I can draft the summary doc and fill in the real table names now, then hand it to "
    "you to look over. Want me to proceed?\" -> winddown (drafting is the reversible work; "
    "review is not authorization)\n"
    "- \"Should I store sessions in Postgres or SQLite? Postgres scales but adds ops; SQLite "
    "is zero-ops but caps at ~50 writers. Which fits your deployment?\" -> not_winddown "
    "(genuine trade-off only the user can pick)\n"
    "- \"The deploy needs a new prod credential I don't have and no independent work "
    "remains - can you complete gcloud auth login locally so the CLI can use its normal "
    "credential store? Do not send credential material in chat.\" -> not_winddown "
    "(blocked on access the agent lacks)\n"
    "- \"The repository declares merged-and-deployed and checks are green. Want me to "
    "merge the task PR?\" -> winddown (the standard landing path is already delegated)\n"
    "- \"The task is scoped and the branch name is declared. Should I create the "
    "Escapement worktree before I begin?\" -> winddown (creating the declared isolated "
    "worktree is an authorized ordinary means, not a human architecture choice)\n"
    "- Request: \"Fix monitoring for both agents end to end.\" Response: \"The remaining "
    "step is to restart and verify the supervisor.\" -> winddown (explicitly unfinished "
    "ordinary work; the agent should restart and verify it now)\n"
    "- \"Done - all 12 tests pass and the report renders the corrected totals.\" -> "
    "not_winddown (progress report, no offer to stop)\n"
    "- Request: \"Diagnose this read-only. Do not edit or restart anything.\" Response: "
    "\"The supervisor exits because task_session_mode is missing; restoring that module "
    "would fix it.\" -> not_winddown (the response completed the authorized diagnosis and "
    "must not violate the explicit no-edit/no-restart boundary)\n"

    "I am fixing that causal failure and will rerun the required checks.\" -> not_winddown "
