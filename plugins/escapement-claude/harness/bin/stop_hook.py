Claude Code Stop-hook adapter for continuation-harness.

Reads the Anthropic hook protocol JSON from stdin, calls would_block_stop
against the active thread directory, logs the decision to incidents.jsonl,
and emits a block decision (with constructive resumption prompt) when warranted.

v0: single active thread at harness/threads/current/. The session_id from the
hook payload is included in the incidents log for later correlation.

Coexists with ~/.claude/hooks/validate_no_shirking.py — both run on Stop;
both can block. Additive coverage.
