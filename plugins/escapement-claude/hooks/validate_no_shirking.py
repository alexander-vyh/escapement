"""Claude Code hook: block outcome-shirking ("pre-existing failure" evasion).

Fires as:
  • PreToolUse  — on git commit / gh pr create / git push
  • Stop        — when the agent declares itself done

When the agent recently used dismissive language about test/job failures
("pre-existing", "not in anything I changed", "unrelated to our changes"),
this hook blocks the finishing action and forces the agent to either:
  1. Fix the failing test/job, OR
  2. Obtain explicit user approval to proceed with a known failure.

Input (via stdin):
  JSON with hook_event_name, tool_name, tool_input, transcript_path
Exit codes:
  0 — allow
  2 — block (JSON output explains why)
