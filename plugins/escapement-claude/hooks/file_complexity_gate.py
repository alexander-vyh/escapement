"""PreToolUse gate: two-tier file-length control (soft guidance + hard stop).

Line count is a weak, pragmatic proxy — not a defect/edit-reliability measurement.
The research behind this gate (.research/file-complexity-gate-2026-06-23/) found no
evidence for a defect-reducing file-LOC ceiling; the honest rationale is that >500
lines *correlates* with two real concerns this repo cares about:
  • Humans: the file likely holds more than one responsibility and gets hard to
    review and navigate atomically.
  • Agents: large files inflate the working set; LLM edit reliability degrades as the
    edit target grows (line-number mis-targeting, weaker localization — see arXiv
    2602.16069, 2506.13186). Successful agent edits keep the working set small.

Two tiers:
  SOFT_LIMIT (500)  — exceed → non-blocking `systemMessage` nudge (allowed). A poor
                      proxy, but >500 LOC is where the concerns above start to bite.
  HARD_LIMIT (1000) — exceed → deny (blocked), human-overridable by waiver.

Exemptions (fail-open on detection failure):
  Path fragments: /vendor/, /node_modules/, /migrations/, /generated/,
                  /testdata/, /fixtures/, /.beads/, /dist/, /build/
  File suffixes:  generated code (.pb.go, _pb2.py, _pb2_grpc.py, .gen.go, .g.dart,
                  .freezed.dart, .generated.ts/.js, .pb.cc, .pb.h, go.sum, .min.js,
                  .min.css, .snap, .lock, -lock.json) and passive data/docs
                  (.json, .yaml, .yml, .csv, .tsv, .svg, .ipynb, .geojson, .md,
                  .txt, .rst) — "extract a sibling module" is meaningless for these.
  Waiver comment: one of the first 5 lines contains
                  `# file-complexity-waiver: <reason>` (or //, --, /* variants).
                  Suppresses BOTH tiers (an acknowledged file is not nagged).
  Env var:        FILE_COMPLEXITY_WAIVER=<reason>

Escape path IN the denial (gate-design rule 1):
  Extract a cohesive responsibility into a sibling module, OR add a waiver.

Signal (gate-design rule 2):
  Emits to _gate_signal with gate_name='file-complexity', decision one of
  soft-nudge | deny | waiver-accepted.

Value-not-presence (gate-design rule 3):
  Waiver must be non-empty after the colon; bare marker is rejected.

Exit codes:
  0  — always. A denial rides the stdout envelope, not the exit status: Codex
       discards a gate that exits non-zero, and Claude honors the envelope
       either way.
