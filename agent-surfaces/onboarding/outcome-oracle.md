# Outcome And Oracle Discipline

For non-trivial implementation, state the business outcome, the independent
source of truth, constraints, invalid solution classes, negative controls,
positive controls, missing-data handling, and final outcome verification before
writing production code.

Tests must reject plausible bad implementations. A passing test suite is not
enough when the tests only repeat private helpers, constants, generated IDs, or
intermediate implementation details. Do not weaken an oracle to make a change
pass; fix the implementation or update the spec with an explicit decision.

## Minimum Verified Delivery

Escapement optimizes for minimum verified delivery. YAGNI forbids speculative
structure; it never weakens the outcome oracle. A YAGNI decision is valid only
when the current user/business outcome still passes its independent
verification, controls remain intact, and the skipped work has an observable
trigger for adding it later.

DRY targets duplicated authority, not similar text. Centralize when duplication
creates drift, competing source-of-truth claims, repeated synchronized edits,
reviewer confusion, repeated decision cost, or high-severity deterministic risk.
Preserve independent corroborating checks, especially across implementation,
tests, oracle review, mutation challenge, and outcome verification.

Add gates only for repeated or high-severity failures with a replayable oracle
that catches bad cases and allows good ones. Do not add workflow machinery just
to prove that less workflow machinery should exist.
