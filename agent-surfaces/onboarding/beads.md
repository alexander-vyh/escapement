# Beads

Run `bd prime` at session start or after context recovery. It is the live source
for workflow context, tracker rules, memories, and close protocol.

Issues live in the local Dolt database under `.beads`; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is
a passive export and must not be treated as the wire protocol. Use `bd ready`,
`bd show <id>`, `bd update <id> --claim`, and `bd close <id>` for work state.

Use `bd worktree create` instead of `git worktree add` in this repo so linked
worktrees share the correct beads database.

Do not use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists for project work
tracking. If follow-up work is discovered, create or update a bead.
