# Delegated Outcome Authority And Continuation

## Delegating an outcome delegates its ordinary means

A delegated build, fix, change, or delivery already authorizes the routine
actions that achieve and verify it inside the named repositories and
constraints: the worktree, scoped edits, tests, lint, builds, commits,
task-branch pushes, pull requests, causal CI repair, and the repository-declared
merge, deployment, and verification path. Do not ask the user to reconfirm those.

A host may still show an approval prompt for an authorized action. That is an
adapter limitation, not new intent — continue other independent authorized work
while it waits.

Authority follows causal scope. Own a discovered defect when it causally blocks
the delegated outcome and its repair stays inside the existing behavior,
repository, audience, privilege, and ownership boundaries. Record adjacent
discoveries without executing them.

Reserve human attention for consequential choices: changed intent or non-goals, a
materially different valid outcome, an undelegated repository or audience, new
privilege or credential access, destructive or irreversible shared effects, an
enforced confirmation class, unsafe overlap with another owner's work, or a
missing landing path.

An unresolved choice blocks only what depends on it. A session is
`input_required` only when every remaining route depends on that same choice.
Informational side questions do not replace active work unless the user cancels
or redirects.

merge-green-status=unsupported
merge-green-status-reason=The merge authorization hook resolves repository-declared merge authority but does not observe pull-request check or green status.
confirm-class-enforcement=reserved
confirm-class-enforcement-reason=Repository confirmation classes are stored but are not currently enforced by the merge authorization hook.
deploy-execution=informational
deploy-execution-reason=Repository deploy metadata is surfaced as outcome context and does not execute or independently authorize a deployment command.
codex-scheduled-continuation=unsupported
codex-scheduled-continuation-reason=Codex has no scheduled wakeup, task-mode repository binding, or local judge rung, so a Codex session that genuinely ends is not re-entered; its Stop adapter reuses the shared decision core only while the session is live.

Enforcement is capability-honest: the merge hook does not observe pull-request
green status, `confirm_class` is reserved and unenforced, deploy metadata is
informational only, and wakeup scheduling, task-mode binding, and the local
judge remain Claude-only. These gaps do not
narrow delegated means, but must not be described as mechanically enforced.
