"""Continuation-harness wind-down rung — judge-driven gate.

The local-LLM judge (winddown_judge.py) is the SOLE wind-down classifier. This
module provides the rung logic that ACTS on the judge's verdict — it does not
classify prose itself.

DESIGN NOTES
- Classification is semantic-only. `winddown_decision` accepts the judge's pre-computed
  verdict via `is_offer`. When `is_offer` is None (judge unavailable), the rung
  fails open: no offer detected, allow. The outage is signalled at the hook layer
  (stop_hook._winddown_override) per gate-design Rule 2.
- The Stop hook has a separate, narrow outage sentinel for transcript-proven
  DWDEV-style wind-down shapes after that signal is recorded. That sentinel is not
  part of this rung and does not reintroduce a general prose classifier here.
- HONEST LIMITATION: the Stop hook fires AFTER the turn is rendered, so this rung forces
  *continuation*; it does NOT un-show the offer text. It converts "agent pauses and waits"
  into "agent offers but keeps going."
