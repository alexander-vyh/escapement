"""
Claude Code Stop-hook adapter for continuation-harness.

Reads the Anthropic hook protocol JSON from stdin, calls would_block_stop
against the active thread directory, logs the decision to incidents.jsonl,
and emits a block decision (with constructive resumption prompt) when warranted.

State is keyed by the hook payload's session_id and, for a subagent, the
CLAUDE_AGENT_ID actor identity. The session_id is also included in the incidents
log for correlation.

Coexists with ~/.claude/hooks/validate_no_shirking.py — both run on Stop;
both can block. Additive coverage.
