"""PostToolUse:ScheduleWakeup bridge for the continuation-harness.

Bead: claude-workflow-setup-0wg.

The problem
-----------
continuation-harness.md documents three Stop-permission paths; path 2 is
"register a wakeup via the ScheduleWakeup tool". But the Stop gate
(would_block_stop) reads ``{thread_dir}/scheduled.json``, while the ScheduleWakeup
*tool* persists inside the Claude Code runtime and never writes that file. So
path 2 was dead: a legitimately-blocked wait-turn still got
``no_completion_or_resumption_proof`` every time. Only verify-pass (path 1) or
user-release (path 3) actually released the gate.

The fix
-------
This module is a PostToolUse hook matched on the ScheduleWakeup tool. After a
ScheduleWakeup call succeeds, it translates the call into a schema-conforming
entry (harness/schemas/scheduled.schema.json) in *that session's* thread dir —
the exact file the gate already reads. ``wake_at = now + clamp(delaySeconds,
60, 3600)`` mirrors the tool's own clamping so the registered time matches the
real wakeup.

Self-pruning (part 2 — stale fallbacks)
---------------------------------------
Two mechanisms keep a stale wakeup from "releasing" the gate forever or replaying
a finished task list:

* On every write the bridge drops past-dated entries and deduplicates its own
  ``created_by == "ScheduleWakeup"`` entries (latest wins) so repeated calls
  don't accumulate.
* ``prune_thread()`` cancels a thread's pending ScheduleWakeup wakeups; the
  ``verify`` script calls it on a passing run, so once tracked work completes the
  wakeup is cancelled and cannot replay (on the harness side). Entries registered
  by other processes (supervisor / adapter fallbacks) are preserved.

  `wakeup_waker.py` reads this — now correctly pruned — scheduled.json as its
  source of truth. Its default mode is dry-run; unattended firing requires the
  daemon/launchd shell to invoke it with `--fire`.

Fail-open: any malformed payload / IO error exits 0 without writing, so the
bridge never blocks or corrupts the agent's tool flow.
