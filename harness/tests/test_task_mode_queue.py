"""Worktree false-allow regression for the task-mode queue-drain Stop gate.

Source / oracle: the 2026-06-01 two-live-stops incident. Session 75be09cc ran
inside the git worktree .worktrees/cake-m95.4-eventlog and allowed Stop eight
times with reason `task_mode_no_beads_in_cwd` while a ready sibling task
(cake-m95.4.2) remained under the molecule root.

Root cause
----------
`_check_task_mode_queue` skipped the entire queue check when the cwd had no
literal `.beads/` directory:

    if not (repo_path / ".beads").exists():
        return ("allow", "task_mode_no_beads_in_cwd")

A git worktree has no `.beads/` dir but `bd` still resolves the shared Dolt DB
via the redirect file / BEADS_DIR env (see beads-worktree-integration rule). So
the gate tested the wrong proxy — a *directory* — instead of the *capability*
(`can bd see the queue?`), and every worktree session was silently ungated.

Business invariant
------------------
A task-mode session with ready, in-scope work remaining must BLOCK Stop,
whether or not the cwd is a worktree. The gate must consult the actual `bd`
queue, degrading to allow ONLY when bd genuinely cannot resolve a queue.

Fragile implementations these tests REJECT
-------------------------------------------
- "no `.beads/` dir -> allow"  (the shipped bug)        -> fails test_worktree_with_ready_work_blocks
- "bd unavailable -> always block"                      -> fails test_non_beads_cwd_degrades_to_allow
- "bd unavailable -> always allow"                      -> fails test_real_beads_repo_bd_failure_blocks
Only a capability probe (run bd; degrade on failure, but stay blocked inside a
real beads repo whose bd merely hiccupped) survives all three.
