"""LIVE prompt-accuracy oracle for the wind-down judge's _SYSTEM classifier.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the gap it closes)
-----------------------------------
test_winddown_judge.py and test_winddown_gate.py inject the transport (`post=`) and
mock the verdict, so they test the ROUTING (verdict -> block/allow) but NEVER the
PROMPT. A prompt can pass every mocked test and still misclassify real messages — which
is exactly what happened: the narrow wrap-only prompt classified a real permission-
solicitation ("Want me to dig up X and draft Y? I can do both now — you'd just review")
as not_winddown, so the Stop gate allowed it and the user got a do-nothing solicitation
after 90s of churn. No mocked test could catch that because none of them exercise the
model. This test does.

THE ORACLE
----------
Business invariant: a turn-final message that offers to do obvious in-scope, reversible
work and asks permission instead of doing it MUST classify as wind-down (so the gate
blocks and the agent proceeds); a message that reports progress or asks a GENUINE
decision the user must own MUST NOT (so the gate does not nag a legitimate turn).

Independent source of truth: the labeled fixture set (fixtures/winddown_labeled.json),
authored from the real failure plus adversarial negative controls, NOT from the prompt's
wording. `expect` is the GATE DECISION (block/allow) the user experiences — not the raw
3-way label — because for a non-punt both not_winddown AND unclear->None both mean allow.

Fragile implementation this rejects: the pre-fix wrap-only prompt. It classifies the
permission-punt fixtures (P1/P4/P5) as not_winddown -> allow, so this test FAILS against
it. It also rejects an over-broad prompt that flags genuine decisions (N1/N4) as
wind-down — those are the negative controls.

TRANSPORT vs CLASSIFICATION: the local model server intermittently returns an empty
completion (message with no `content`) -> the client fails open to None. None is a
TRANSPORT outcome, not a classification, so we retry (spaced) to obtain real verdicts and
assert only on what the model actually returned. A positive case that never yields a real
verdict is an infra outage (skip that case), not a prompt regression. A single real
not_winddown on a positive — or a single real winddown on a negative — is a hard failure.

This test is SKIPPED when the local judge is unreachable (it cannot run without the
model). That is legitimate environment-gating, not oracle suppression: when the model IS
up, every fixture is asserted.

    `/v1/models` answering 200 is necessary but NOT sufficient: the model-list endpoint

    / HTTP 000), in which case every `model_verdict` yields None and the positive-case
    assertion fails instead of skipping (escapement-pgo / u4a0 — observed 2026-07-07:
    /v1/models=200 while /v1/chat/completions=000).

    CRITICAL — this must NOT suppress a real oracle failure. The chat probe skips ONLY on
    a CONNECTION-DEAD signal (transport unreachable / non-2xx status). A chat endpoint that
    RESPONDS 200 — even with the intermittent empty-content fail-open the retry loop is
    designed to absorb — counts as UP, so a live model that misclassifies a fixture still
    reaches the assertion and still FAILS (never-suppress: an infra skip may only cover
    dead transport, never a wrong-but-live verdict). So we key on transport reachability,
