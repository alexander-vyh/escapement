"""B1 regression — the SHIPPED plugin hooks.json must WIRE the harness Stop gate,
and the wired gate must actually BLOCK an unverified Stop.

Source / oracle brief: docs/assessments/2026-05-28-critical-assessment.md (B1),
bead escapement-fxh.1.

Business invariant
------------------
A user who installs the escapement plugin gets a LIVE
continuation-harness Stop gate — not merely the stop_hook.py file on disk. The
bug being guarded: the template's Stop block invoked only validate_no_shirking.py,
so distributees who merge it (per INSTALL.sh) symlinked the harness code but never
wired the gate. The harness was dead-on-arrival for everyone but the author, whose
hand-edited ~/.claude/settings.json masked the gap.

Fragile implementations these tests REJECT
-------------------------------------------
- "stop_hook.py exists on disk"  -> already TRUE via symlink; passes despite the bug.
- swapping validate_no_shirking for stop_hook -> must be ADDITIVE (both run); the two
  gates are complementary per claude/rules/continuation-harness.md.
- "INSTALL.sh mentions stop_hook" in a comment -> wiring must be in the template's
  parsed Stop command list, not prose.

Run: python3 -m pytest harness/tests/test_stop_gate_wiring.py -q
