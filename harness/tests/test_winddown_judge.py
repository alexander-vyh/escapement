"""Tests for winddown_judge.py — the local-LLM judge is the SOLE classifier.

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (user directive): the regex floor is KILLED. Wind-down
classification in the judge/rung path is semantic — the judge's verdict is the
only signal there. There is no regex fallback inside `decide(...)`, which resolves
the offer purely from `model_offer`:
  - model_offer True  → offer
  - model_offer False → not an offer
  - model_offer None  → judge unavailable/unclear → FAIL-OPEN to allow (semantic
    and the outage is SIGNALLED (gate-design Rule 2) at the hook layer.
The Stop hook has a separate high-confidence outage sentinel for known DWDEV-style
wind-down shapes; these tests cover the judge/rung contract, not that sentinel.
The HTTP call is injected (`post=`) so tests never depend on a running server.

These tests pin two load-bearing behaviors the live run can't guarantee on every
machine:
  - FAIL-OPEN: model down / error / garbage verdict → None → allow (no fabricated block).
  - JUDGE OWNS RECALL: every offer/non-offer classification comes from the verdict,
    not from any string pattern.
