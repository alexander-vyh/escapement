"""Tests for the stop-gate blocker-laundering close-out (R2 + R3).

WHY THIS EXISTS
A 931k-token session quit by laundering its stop through the harness's own
vocabulary: it filed a blocker bead ("blocked on another team's test / Salesforce
delivery timing" — the "other team" did not exist), which drained `bd ready`, so
`_check_task_mode_queue` returned ("allow", "queue_drained"), and the model wrote
"This is a clean, honest stopping point." and stopped. No ScheduleWakeup, blocker
claim validated by nothing. Three holes lined up; R1 (winddown floor) is pinned in
test_winddown_gate.py. This file pins:

  R2 — empty `bd ready` + ≥1 SCOPED blocked bead no longer grants a free
       queue_drained allow; it BLOCKS with ("block", "blocked_tasks_no_wakeup")
       whose display text names ScheduleWakeup / unblock-or-close / user-stop.
       Empty ready + ZERO blocked stays ("allow", "queue_drained"). The blocked
       probe is SCOPED (--parent) like `bd ready`, so a session parked beside
       unrelated blocked backlog still drains.

  R3 — blocker_verify.py: a `blocker-verify: <cmd>` must EXIT 0 (run with bounded
       timeout) to confirm; a `blocker-waiver: <reason>` must be ≥20 chars and not
       a placeholder. Trivial verify commands ("true", ":", "exit 0", empty) are
       rejected WITHOUT execution (value-not-presence, gate-design Rule 3). When
       the release path is a wakeup AND scoped blocked beads exist, every gating
       blocked bead must carry a passing verify OR a valid waiver — else
       ("block", "wakeup_blocker_unverified"). user_released stays unconditional.

FRAGILE IMPLEMENTATIONS THESE TESTS REJECT
- F1 presence-only verify: any nonempty command string "passes" without running.
      -> killed by test_verify_false_command_is_unverified (runs, exits 1) and
         test_trivial_verify_commands_rejected_without_execution.
- F2 display-only gate: add display text but still return "allow".
      -> killed by R2 tests asserting decision == "block", and the R3 integration
         test asserting ("block", "wakeup_blocker_unverified").
- F4 unscoped blocked probe: query repo-wide blocked beads.
      -> killed by test_scoped_blocked_probe_ignores_out_of_scope: the SCOPED
         blocked query returns [] (impl must allow) even though an unscoped query
         would return blocked backlog.
- F5 waiver presence-only: accept any nonempty waiver reason.
      -> killed by test_waiver_placeholder_rejected / test_waiver_too_short_rejected.

# --- NOTE 3: back-compat parity between the two production run_bd helpers --------
#
# `_check_task_mode_queue`'s production run_bd maps `exit 0 + non-JSON stdout -> []`
# (back-compat for an older bd whose `blocked` subcommand is absent), returning None
# only on a genuine failure. `_check_wakeup_blockers`'s production run_bd lacks that
# mapping (it returns None on any JSONDecodeError regardless of exit code). The
# OBSERVABLE consequence is currently SAFE — both paths release on old bd (the wakeup
# path because line `blocked is None or len==0 -> allow`). We pin that OBSERVABLE
# CONTRACT (old bd degrades to a wakeup release) directly against the PRODUCTION
# runner, so the cosmetic asymmetry can never silently become a behavioral divergence
# (e.g. a future change that makes the wakeup path fail-toward-block on None would
# regress old-bd installs into permanent traps — this test would catch it).
