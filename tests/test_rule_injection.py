"""Oracle for SessionStart rules injection.

Business outcome
----------------
A session starts already holding the rules that change what an agent does, and
does not spend context on reference material it can read on demand. Before
this, the injector concatenated every `claude/rules/*.md` in full — the
same context cost for a 70-line worked example as for the sentence that changes
the next action. Every host package (Claude, Codex, Pi) ships the same
injector beside its own rules bundle, so each bundle is held to this oracle.

Independent source of truth
---------------------------
The packaged hook's actual stdout, executed the way a host executes it
(python, JSON on stdin and stdout). Not the renderer's template string, and
not the marker constants re-derived here — those would be implementation
echoes of the thing under test.

Invalid solution classes this suite rejects
-------------------------------------------
- A rule silently disappearing from the session -> ``test_every_rule_still_reaches_the_session``
- Marked detail still being injected (no saving at all) -> ``test_marked_detail_is_held_back``
- Held-back detail with no way to reach it -> ``test_held_back_rules_say_where_to_read_the_rest``
- Truncating a rule that never opted in -> ``test_unmarked_rule_is_injected_whole``
- Silently eating the tail on an unclosed marker -> ``test_unclosed_marker_injects_the_rule_intact``
- A broken install failing quietly -> ``test_missing_bundle_still_fails_loud``
