# Behavioral Test Oracle Review

Use this before implementation for non-trivial changes where a superficial test could pass a fragile implementation.

## Required Output

Produce a Test Oracle Brief:
1. Business invariant: what user/business outcome must be true?
2. Independent source of truth: what proves correctness without copying the implementation?
3. Solution constraints: what repo, language, framework, security, ownership, or maintainability constraints must hold?
4. Invalid solution classes: what kinds of solutions are disallowed even if they produce today's output?
5. Fragile implementation to reject: name at least one tempting shortcut.
6. Negative control: what fixture, row, request, role, input, or scenario should fail if the code is wrong?
7. Positive control: what proves valid output is not accidentally dropped?
8. Missing/unresolved handling: should missing lookup/source data fail closed, fail open, or be explicitly allowed?
9. Final outcome verification: what command, query, report, API call, UI flow, or workflow proves the actual result?

## Review Rule

Reject the test plan if the named fragile implementation would pass every relevant behavioral, fixture, contract, architecture, and static check.

## Common Oracle Smells

- Same magic constant in code and test
- Test duplicates the implementation algorithm
- Mock interaction is asserted without an outcome assertion
- Private helper is asserted instead of public behavior
- Generated ID is used as business identity
- Snapshot has no semantic assertion
- No negative control
- No positive control, so an empty result could pass
- Final output is not checked
- Intermediate artifact is tested when the user cares about downstream output

## Handoff

Before implementation begins, state:
- the business invariant
- the independent oracle
- the invalid solution classes
- the fragile implementation that must fail
- the tests/checks that reject it
- the final outcome verification surface
