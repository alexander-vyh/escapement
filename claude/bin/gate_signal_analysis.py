"""Recurrence / half-life analysis over the gate-signal log.

Closes the gate-signal *learning loop*. Per
`claude/rules/gate-design.md` Rule 2 every gate appends a record to
`.beads/.gate-signal.jsonl`, and per the bureaucracy principle's
**Operating Rule 1** ("every rule has a half-life") the half-life
review must look at *which reasons recur* to decide whether a gate's
heuristic should be updated or the rule itself revised. Writing
signal that nobody aggregates is petrification wearing a learning-loop
costume — this script is the missing consumer.

It is deliberately distinct from its sibling readers:

  - `gate_signal_query.py` lists per-gate counts and sample reasons for
    one repo / window. It does not cluster recurring reasons or rank
    them by recency.
  - `gate_signal_monitor.py` aggregates raw counts across every repo
    under ~/GitHub. It does not produce a recurrence ranking or a
    half-life verdict per reason.

This script answers the two questions Operating Rule 1 actually asks:

  1. **Recurrence** — which gates fire most (firing frequency), and
     which *reason texts* recur across firings? A reason that recurs
     many times is labeled training data: the gate's heuristic is
     hitting the same case repeatedly and may want to be updated.
  2. **Half-life** (``--half-life``) — for each recurring reason, is it
     *still* recurring recently or has it gone quiet? A reason that
     recurs and is still active argues for revising the heuristic now;
     a reason that recurred historically but has been silent for a long
     time is a candidate for retirement (the rule it protected may be
     petrified). The half-life report ranks recurring reasons by both
     recurrence count and recency so the reviewer can triage.

## Usage

    python3 claude/bin/gate_signal_analysis.py            # recurrence report
    python3 claude/bin/gate_signal_analysis.py --half-life # + half-life triage
    python3 claude/bin/gate_signal_analysis.py --since 30d
    python3 claude/bin/gate_signal_analysis.py --json
    python3 claude/bin/gate_signal_analysis.py --self-test # behavioral controls

## Failure behavior

Fails *soft* when the signal file is missing or empty: it prints a
notice and still emits the report headers (with zero rows) so the
learning loop is observably closed even before any signal exists, and
the script always exits 0 in that case. A missing log is a normal
early state, not an error — mirrors the fail-soft contract of the
writer in `claude/hooks/_gate_signal.py`.
