"""PreToolUse gate on `gh pr merge` — the deterministic merge-authorization check.

Motivated by a real incident (2026-07-04, simplifi/cro-reporting PR #262): an agent
told the user "the only remaining step is merging ... a platform-level gate, not
something resolvable from my side" when no such gate existed (GitHub branch
protection: 404 Branch not protected) — the repo simply had no
`.escapement/repo.json` declaration. Two existing enforcement layers
(continuation-harness.md rule text, and the Stop-gate backstop in stop_hook.py)
both operate around the merge decision, not AT it — neither intercepts a `gh pr
merge` invocation itself, so an agent that decides (correctly or not) whether to
attempt the merge is reasoning in free text with no mechanical backstop at the
point of action. This hook is that backstop: it resolves the same
`.escapement/repo.json` declaration `repo_outcome.py` already reads for the
Stop-gate, and lets the file's declaration — not the agent's in-context guess —
decide whether the merge proceeds.

Fail-safe by construction, mirroring repo_outcome.py's own philosophy: any error
resolving the declaration (missing reader, unreadable file, resolver exception)
denies rather than allows. An unconfigured or unresolvable repo behaves exactly
like today — stop and ask — it is never upgraded to authorization by a broken
check.

Escape path: `# merge-authorization-waiver: <reason>` appended to the `gh pr merge`
command, once the user has given explicit go-ahead in the conversation this turn.
The denial reason always names the TRUE cause (no repo.json declaration, or a
malformed one) — it must never be paraphrased into a fabricated external
constraint; that fabrication is the exact defect this gate exists to make
impossible once a merge is actually attempted.
