"""Claude Code hook: nudge toward the `gate-design` skill when editing a gate.

The mechanical half of the gate-design rule->skill conversion (option D+B):
the full gate-design manual lives in the on-demand `gate-design` skill, a
3-rule checklist stays resident as a stub rule, and THIS PreToolUse nudge
catches the file-edit trigger a resident checklist might miss.

When you Write/Edit a gate-ish file — a hook `.py`, a file with `gate` in its
name, or `settings.template.json` (gate wiring) — it injects a one-line
systemMessage reminding you to load the `gate-design` skill before building the
gate, so the deny gets an escape path, the gate emits signal, and any required
value is validated (not merely present).

This is a NUDGE, never a gate: it emits only `systemMessage` and exits 0. It
NEVER returns permissionDecision, so it can never block an edit.

Scope is deliberately tight (gate-ish paths only) so it is signal, not noise —
ordinary edits pass silently. No cooldown in v1: the message is one line and
becomes a no-op once the skill is loaded; add a cooldown later if it proves
noisy during heavy gate work.

Exit codes:
  0 — always (advisory only, never blocks)
