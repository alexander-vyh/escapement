"""Claude Code hook: soft gate on bd close — warns if no review agent was dispatched.

Dual-purpose PreToolUse hook:
  - On Agent calls: checks if name/description contains "review" and records it
    in a per-session state file under /tmp/
  - On Bash calls: checks if the command is `bd close` or `bd update --status closed`
    and warns if no review agent was recorded for this session

This is advisory (soft warning) — it never blocks, only nudges.

Input (via stdin):
  JSON with hook_event_name, tool_name, tool_input, session_id
Exit codes:
  0 — allow (with optional system message warning)
