"""Codex-specific behavioral tests for openspec_task_reconciliation_gate.py.

Loads the hook from the repo path (no ~/.claude/hooks/ dependency) so these run
in Codex environments. The bd-issue and tasks.md filesystem boundaries
(get_issue, extract_spec_id, check_tasks_spec_id) are patched so tests are
hermetic and do not depend on a real beads DB or openspec directory.

The hook fires as PreToolUse on Bash `bd close` commands. It denies closing a
bead that links (via spec_id) to an OpenSpec task whose `tasks.md` checkbox is
not yet `[x]` — enforcing that work is reconciled before close.

Positive control: bd close of a spec-linked bead whose tasks ARE complete -> allow.
Negative control: bd close of a spec-linked bead whose tasks are NOT complete -> deny.
Fast-paths: non-`bd close` commands, unknown issues, and beads without a
spec_id are always allowed.
