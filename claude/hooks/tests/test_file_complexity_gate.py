"""Oracle for the file-complexity gate (two-tier: 500 soft / 1000 hard).

Business invariant
------------------
A Write/Edit to a NON-exempt file is graded by projected line count:
  • <= 500           -> PASS, silent (exit 0, no stdout)
  • 501 .. 1000      -> SOFT guidance (exit 0, stdout ``systemMessage``) — allowed
  • > 1000           -> HARD block (exit 0, ``hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision:
                       deny``) — unless waived
A substantive waiver (``# file-complexity-waiver: <reason>`` in the first 5 lines, or
``FILE_COMPLEXITY_WAIVER`` env) suppresses BOTH tiers. Exempt paths/suffixes always
pass. The gate fails OPEN on malformed input or unreadable targets — never crashes a
session.

Independent source of truth
---------------------------
The 500/1000 thresholds and the waiver convention — asserted via the externally
observable hook contract (exit code + stdout decision), NOT by importing the
constants and recomputing them (that would be an implementation echo).

Fragile implementations this suite rejects
-------------------------------------------
- Fail-open / always-allow over the hard limit -> ``test_write_over_hard_limit_denies``
- "Just raise the limit to 1000" (kills the soft tier) -> ``test_six_hundred_is_soft_not_silent``
- "Everything over 500 is just a nudge now" (kills the hard block)
      -> ``test_twelve_hundred_is_hard_not_soft``
- Over-blocking at the soft boundary -> ``test_write_exactly_at_soft_limit_allows``
- Presence-only waiver (empty reason bypasses) -> ``test_empty_waiver_reason_still_denies``
- Ignoring exemptions -> ``test_exempt_suffix_allows`` / ``test_new_data_exemptions``
- Message the reader cannot act on -> ``test_soft_message_is_actionable``
- Message so long nobody reads it -> ``test_messages_stay_short_enough_to_read``
- Codex apply_patch writes ungated -> ``test_codex_file_complexity_gate.py``
